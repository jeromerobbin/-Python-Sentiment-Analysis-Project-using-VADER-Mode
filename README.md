# -Python-Sentiment-Analysis-Project-using-VADER-Mode


n this project, I delved into natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment expressed in text data. Using Python's robust libraries and the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) model, I was able to accurately gauge the sentiment of textual content, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
